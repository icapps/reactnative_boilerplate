### Storybook
Storybook is a UI development environment for your UI components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

- start storybook by using `yarn storybook`, followed by `yarn ios`or `yarn android`.
- Add new stories by using `[component].story.js` (`yarn storybook` needs to be run again when creating a new file)
